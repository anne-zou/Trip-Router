# Trip-Router
Android client application for a Socially Optimal Multi-Modal Routing Platform

Utilizes the Google Maps and Google Places APIs to create a UI for routing and navigation. Uses the Retrofit HTTP-client to fetch trip-routing data from servers running the following engine: https://github.com/visor-vu/trip-planner-routing-engine

This project is structured according to the Model-View-Controller pattern, such that the source of the trip-routing data can be easily be swapped for a different one by modifying only the Model layer.

This application was built during a research internship with the [SCOPE-Lab](http://scope.isis.vanderbilt.edu/) at Vanderbilt University at the Institute of Software Integrated Systems.
